Hi everybody.

00:02.200 --> 00:07.166
This is a quick overview on how
we're going to do Color Wheel Part One.

00:07.166 --> 00:08.833
So there are two parts of this test.

00:08.833 --> 00:11.633
They're basically variations
on the same thing, but we split it up into

00:11.633 --> 00:12.433
two separate parts.
